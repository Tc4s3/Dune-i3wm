# Dune-i3wm
My Dune/Retro inspired i3wm config

#Background

My deepest rice to date after recently coming back to the window manager approach 
& glad i finally made the switch, no more DE, no Login manager, just xinit, 
i3wm, some gtk frills & polybar and my all time go to Terminess font ofc. 
This rice was inspired by the Dune books & film series, id just finished
Children of Dune when i started, the desire for a more lighter theme, 
Late 90's/Early2000's retro computing and a little bit of a reaction to 
high gloss fancier contemporary computing aesthetics, no animations, no transparencies, 
just simplicity & limited colors. 
Config is fairly sparse just a simple polybar with some custom modules, 
a bit of fancy katakana and i3wm's default window decorations, 
title bars are gonna come back in a big way i can feel it,oh and a retroCSS pack 
i found for Firefox colored by the Firefox Color Extension, 
(i did some light editing to the userchromes icon set), 
all tied together with Gruvbox-yellow-gtk. 
Im gonna work on a Dark mode companion rice to this under the project title 
Geidi Prime at some point in the future but for now
im just gonna chill in the sands of Arrakis.
