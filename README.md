# Dune-i3wm
To quote here_for_the_kittens "My desert. My Arch. My Dune."

My Dune/Retro inspired i3wm config.

These are the dot files for my retro computing / dune inspired rice, the gtk stuff was configured 
with nwg, wallpaper is a heavy edit of this;
https://wall.alphacoders.com/big.php?i=1191585 ;

the fetch is stored under "bashfetch" in the scripts direcory and is a basic bash script that fetches
basic system info, bring your own ascii art.

the other scripts are for my rofi launching, showing colors in bashfetch.sh and my polybar modules
everything else is under config & Konsole.

ive included two lists, one containingthe gruvbox aur pkgs im using and another listing the fonts i use, enjoy!
